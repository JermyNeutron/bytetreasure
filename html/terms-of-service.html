                            <p>Any reference to a buyer or seller being “verified” indicates only that the buyer or seller has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by ByteTreasure about any buyer or seller, including their identity, background or whether they are trustworthy, safe or suitable.</p>
                            <p>To access or use some of the ByteTreasure Services, you may be asked to provide proof of identity or other methods of identity verification. You agree to provide ByteTreasure or any third party which provides goods or services to ByteTreasure with all identification documents (including but not limited to, copies of passports and/or government-issued driver’s license) which ByteTreasure requests from you from time to time for the purposes of verifying your identity.</p>

                            <p>ByteTreasure gives sellers the ability to connect their asset to third party providers including but not limited to Google Analytics, Google AdSense, Shopify, WooCommerce, Stripe and more. A listing marked “Data Verified” indicates that the seller has connected with at least one of these product providers.</p>
                            <p>ByteTreasure has a team of specialists, including our broker partners, who are equipped to review assets to ensure the accuracy of data displayed and therefore help to preserve the integrity of our marketplace. A listing marked “Vetted by Flippa” indicates that a ByteTreasure representative, or broker partner, has reviewed and verified the information provided by a seller to confirm it is accurate.</p>
                            <p>Despite the fact that an asset or business is marked “Data Verified” and/or “Vetted by ByteTreasure,” ByteTreasure makes no warranties or representations as to the accuracy and completeness of the data displayed or the current or future performance of a business or an asset.  Third party data verification or review by ByteTreasure, or one of its broker partners, is not a substitute for due diligence. As a buyer, you understand you are responsible for investigating all aspects of any purchase of assets, including independently reviewing financial information, market circumstances, operational issues, supplier contacts, and other factors relating to the functioning of the business. ByteTreasure recommends you supplement the information provided by ByteTreasure, or a broker partner, with your own investigation and analysis.</p>

                            <p>ByteTreasure gives buyers the ability to become funds verified (“<b>Funds Verified Buyer</b>“). A Funds Verified Buyer is a registered ByteTreasure buyer who has verified with Plaid.com and/or manually submitted documents to ByteTreasure. A minimum of USD$5,000 in qualifying assets is required. A Funds Verified Buyer can be easily identified with a “Funds Verified” badge on their public profile. A Funds Verified Buyer will receive exclusive access to listings with an asking price exceeding USD$250,000 and in the case of a CONFIDENTIAL listing, will receive automatic approval to access the listing once they have signed the relevant NDA. Buyers who have registered with ByteTreasure prior to April 1, 2022 and who have a purchase history, and who have not yet verified proof of funds will have access to listings with an ask price equal to 5 times their total purchase history. These buyers will not however become Funds Verified Buyers until they have connected to Plaid or manually submitted documentation. </p>

                    <span>ByteTreasure's Role</span>
                    <p>ByteTreasure allows third-party sellers to list and sell their assets using the ByteTreasure Services. ByteTreasure does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, offer or deliver listings or the assets contained therein. The relevant seller is indicated on the respective listing page. While ByteTreasure helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Website, ByteTreasure is not a buyer or seller in any transaction involving the seller’s assets or any other transaction among users of the Services.</p>
                    <p>ByteTreasure provides an avenue for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions. Accordingly, the contract agreed to by the sellers and buyers regarding the seller’s assets is solely between the buyer and seller. ByteTreasure is not a party to this contract and does not assume any responsibility arising out of or in connection with the contract and/or the transaction.  ByteTreasure does not act as an agent for the buyer or seller. The seller is solely responsible for the sale of their assets and the buyer is solely responsible for the purchase of the assets.</p>
                    <p>By using the Services, buyer and seller acknowledge that in the event of a dispute between a buyer and seller, ByteTreasure is not a party to any transaction among the parties and therefore will not participate in any such dispute, except as follows.  Buyer and seller acknowledge and agree that ByteTreasure may, upon receiving notice of a dispute from either party, and only prior to the shipping and/or delivery of the assets or under any circumstance where the following is not possible, choose in its sole and absolute discretion to cancel the transaction. In such an event buyer and seller acknowledge and agree that neither party shall have any cause of action against ByteTreasure and in the event either party should pursue litigation against ByteTreasure the non-litigating party shall hold ByteTreasure harmless in accordance with clause 22.</p>
                    <p>ByteTreasure is not responsible for:</p>

                    <p>To help facilitate a safe, secure transaction and to preserve the integrity of the ByteTreasure Services, you can access legal services and template legal documents via FlippaLegal powered by Contracts Counsel.

You agree that ByteTreasure nor Contracts Counsel has not in any way provided legal or financial advice by providing these documents or made representations or warranties that they are suitable for your requirements or needs and may not be appropriate or suitable to the sale or purchase of a particular asset.

                    <span>Listing Types</span>
                    <p>ByteTreasure enables two kinds of listings — auction-format listings and fixed-price listings.</p>
                    <p>With a fixed price-listing, any buyer can offer to purchase the asset contained in a listing. An offer must be placed on the listing. A seller can accept, reject or counter any offer. If you are a buyer and have placed an offer, you acknowledge and agree that should the seller accept that offer, you are committing to purchase the asset and may be required to pay for it. If you are a seller and have accepted an offer, you acknowledge and agree that you are committing to sell the listed asset to the buyer.</p>
                    <p>With an auction-format listing, a seller will accept bids from buyers for a predetermined amount of time — generally 30 days. For a bid to be valid, it must be higher than the starting price or then-current bid. At the end of the auction, the asset subject of the listing will be declared sold to the highest bidder, provided their bid exceeds the reserve price set by the seller. Should you win the auction, you agree that you are committing to purchase the listed asset and may be required to pay for it.</p>
                    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, ByteTreasure is not an auctioneer and a seller conducts an auction on their own behalf.</p>
                    <p>A listing may also show a ‘buy it now’ button with a price listed next to it. A buyer may purchase a listed asset simply by clicking the ‘buy it now’ button, provided it is accepted by the seller. By clicking ‘buy it now,’ a buyer commits to buying the listed asset.</p>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Exclusivity</span>
                    <p>If a listed asset has a set asking price, in the case of a fixed-priced listed, or a reserve price, in the case of an auction-format listing, equal to or above USD$25,000, you agree that you will promote and/or sell that asset exclusively using the ByteTreasure Services.</p>
                    <p>For assets and online businesses valued up to $100,000 and for the period in which your asset(s) is for sale with ByteTreasure and for 90 days from the date you remove your listing, you warrant that you will not use any other platform, marketplace or service, including a broker service, to promote or sell your asset, without the express written permission of ByteTreasure.</p>
                    <p>For assets and online businesses valued up to $15MM and for the period in which your asset(s) is for sale with ByteTreasure and for 180 days from the date you remove your listing, you warrant that you will not use any other platform, marketplace or service, including a broker service, to promote or sell your asset, without the express written permission of ByteTreasure.</p>
                    <p>If ByteTreasure discovers that you have been in violation of this clause 10, you acknowledge and agree that ByteTreasure has the right to immediately suspend your listing and terminate your account and may, at its discretion, take action against you to recover a success fee.</p>
